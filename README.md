# Extracting-Data-from-JSON
 In this project I wrote a Python program. The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:

We provide a file for this assignment. The file contains the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_283327.json 

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL.


Data Format.

The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON.
